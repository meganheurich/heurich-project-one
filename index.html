  <h1>Megan Heurich: Background and Ambitions</h1>
  <p>
      I am Megan Heurich, a fourth year Communication major, Entrepreneurship
      minor and will graduate from IIT this May. I am currently applying for
      positions in marketing, communications, PR & HR in Chicago and across other
      major cities in the United States. My professional background experience
      includes marketing and communications work with the nonprofit Skills for
      Chicagoland’s Future and nearly four years in the salon and beauty industry.

      During the summer of 2019 I spent the month of June with 21 IIT students
      collecting survey data in Osaka, Japan on foreign tourists’ disaster
      preparedness. Our data will help the government further develop a disaster
      preparedness app and website. I was one of five students chosen to present
      our research findings to the Osaka Prefecture Government on June 27, 2019.

      I am interested in furthering my knowledge of web design as I find this
      skill useful in my personal and professional life. As am employee of a
      small business for nearly four years, I have witnessed the impact of a
      strong internet presence firsthand. I know that the ability to create
      original content on the internet is priceless. I’m looking forward to
      bringing what I learn in this class to my boss.
